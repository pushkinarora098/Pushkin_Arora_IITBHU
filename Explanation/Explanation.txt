1. Multiple line input was taken.
2. This input was containing multiple lines seperated by a full stop and a line('.\n')[not the last line]
3. This input was splitted using split function and was stored under a variable r.
4. Now noun chunks were provided (using Spacy library in python) and were stored in a array b thus the subject and object are in b
5. now again the root was appended to b as displayed in code's #append part
6. This array b was appended to an empty array c
7. Thus a matrix is formed.
8. The third elements of array c are common most of the times. thus they should be extracted to further form the Knowledge Graph.
9. Thus they were extracted and stored in an array j. 
9. I assumed that first line is universal one and we can decide according to that.
10. Thus first element of c array's first elemnt was taken and matched with all others and stord in an array g accordingly
   similarly with second element of c array's first elementand stored in other array f array.
example. 0th test case:

            g                	      f 
	football team	|	football player
	Juventus	|	Cristiano 
	Barcelona	| 	Lionel Messi    

11. Now the knowledge graph was printed as follows:
    :ith element of both arrays g and f were linked and printed 
    :each element of array f leaving the first one was linked ith first one and printed
    :each element of array g leaving the first one was linked ith first one and printed


That's all for the explanation
